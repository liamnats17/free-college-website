        <h2>Why College Should Be Free</h2>
        <p>Free college education has the potential to transform society by increasing accessibility to higher education, reducing student debt, and boosting economic growth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Accessibility:</strong> Free tuition eliminates barriers for low-income and marginalized students, creating a more equitable society. <em>For instance, the average combined cost of undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board at four-year institutions has doubled since 2000, making higher education less accessible to low-income students.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Debt:</strong> Graduates with less debt can contribute more to the economy, purchase homes, and save for the future. <em>Currently, the total student loan debt in the U.S. has reached $1.73 trillion, significantly impacting graduates' financial stability.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> An educated workforce generates higher tax revenue and reduces reliance on public assistance. <em>Four-year college graduates earn 31% more annually than those with only high school diplomas, contributing an additional $1.2 trillion to the economy over 10 years.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            "According to College Board research, four-year college graduates paid, on average, 82% more in taxes than high school graduates." — Wingspan Staff

        <h2>Addressing the Opposition</h2>
        <p>Critics argue that free college might lower educational quality or strain public finances. Here’s why these fears are unfounded:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Taxpayer Burden:</strong> Implementing free college programs can lead to increased tax revenues that offset the initial public investment. <em>For example, the annual benefits of a free-college program would exceed the annual costs within a decade.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Student Motivation:</strong> Free college initiatives can enhance student motivation and enrollment. <em>A randomized control trial in Milwaukee Public Schools found that the availability of free college funds increased students' motivation and steps toward college enrollment.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Strain:</strong> Concerns about infrastructure strain due to increased enrollment can be managed with strategic planning. <em>The Brookings Institution notes that the design of free college programs is crucial, and proper implementation can mitigate potential issues related to infrastructure and capacity.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            "Free college sounds simple enough—but in reality, it involves many choices tied to different interpretations of the word ‘free.’" — Anthony P. Carnevale, et al.
